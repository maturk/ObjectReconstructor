# ObjectReconstructor

Object shape reconstruction from RGB-D images. Object centric shape and appearance code auto-encoder trained on synthetic ShapeNet models with Blender.

This repo is a part of my semester project at the Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Zurich related to Object Shape Registration and Pose Estimation of unseen objects. 

Work in progress...
